Our product for this itteration of planning was to be a chat client that could join precreated rooms and sign in as a user, and see messages from other users. Additionally, we felt a GUI was not warrented for this stage in development. We focused primarily on 3 user stories, which demanded that the user should be able to register and log in, that he or she is able to post messages and read them, and that the user would be able to subscribe to certain boards. We achieved the basic functionality of all these 3 features and our product can now be used in those 3 manners. When the program is run the user can choose what he or she wishes to do and can make choices using the command line interface. Although the program does not currently communicate with any server, the data is still persistent and does not end after program is terminated, meaning our trasistion to server side technology should be very simple, and will allow us to focus on more complex features for "Phase Kanban".
