The multiples commits from the creation of Controller:

I looked through the creation of controller on monday the 10th november 2014. (There are a bunch). The few issues I noticed mainly had to do with how you created and stored your variables, and who called what. You accepted most of my changes while writting the node (as we used pair programming). 

I particularly like how you implemented the MVC as we saw in class to allow for multiple view use (will likely be useful for the GUI).
