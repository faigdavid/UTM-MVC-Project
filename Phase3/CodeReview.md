The features which I focused most during this review are the credit section, the fixed regex, and the refresh function which can all be found here: https://github.com/csc301-fall2014/Proj-UTM-Team6-repo/commit/57e2b236e45fea32e334c9765b0ae3eacf6da2a7. The code that you wrote for the credit section was both succint and humorous. The refresh function worked in both cases and was easily understandable. However, the regex portion may not be entirely correct because it says /w would be an acceptable input for private messaging, which is problematic since we didn't actually implement private messaging. This would create some problems if the user entered /w as an input. However overall your code was of high quality and was very easily understandable.

The multiples commits from the creation of Controller:

I looked through the creation of controller on monday the 10th november 2014. (There are a bunch). The few issues I noticed mainly had to do with how you created and stored your variables, and who called what. You accepted most of my changes while writting the node (as we used pair programming). 

I particularly like how you implemented the MVC as we saw in class to allow for multiple view use (will likely be useful for the GUI).
