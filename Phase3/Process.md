The list of columns which we  chose to reprsent our process on the Kanban board is as follows:

Concept: This stage was for conceptualizing and visualizing how the idea should work, and how it should interact with the rest of the code in theory.
Skeleton Code: This stage made sure that the functions were represented by skeleton code, for example an empty collection of functions with descriptions of what they should return and what they should take in. 
Implementation: Here we actually coded the functions based on the first two progressions. This made sure that what we were returning was the data we were actually looking for.
Testing: This is self-explanatory. During this phase the code we wrote in the third stage is rigourously tested and bugs are fixed. 

We chose a fairly small WIP limit as we wanted to make sure that features were finished in the short time frame that we had, rather than being too spread out and starting a lot of functions and ending up not finishing any.
This is why we chose a WIP limit of 2, as it allowed us to accomplish the goal I described previously. This limit worked fairly well for us, and we did not have to change it throughout the process. 

Similarly to the first stage we chose not to use issues too extensively after multiple attempts. At first the issues raised could be created by any user and left up for grabs. If there was a conflict between who wanted
to solve the issue, they had to discuss it between each other. However due to the fact that we mostly worked closely together, constantly communicating there was really no point in using issues and it would simply slow us down 
as pointless bureaucracy. 

Kanban VS Scrum

There were certainly benefits to both systems but we ended up deciding that Scrum seemed slightly better at organizing our workflow. The main idea behind this is that the Scrum process helped us to create and stick to deadlines.
The Scrum meetings were treated as deadlines which really helped motivate the team to finish the task at hand. Kanban, on the other hand had the benefit of allowing far more freedom and was a lot less constricting than Scrum.
This was mainly due to the fact that it didn't require set meetings, or really rigid deadlines. We could meet whenever it was best for us, and work when we saw fit which was apreciated by the team. This however was a double edge
sword as due to the lack of these rigid rules and deadlines we often worked too little during a certain period and too much during another. This meant that it was more troublesome for us to organize ourselves and make sure we 
were sticking to our time lmits. Another slight benefit to the Kanban process was the lack of documentation we had to keep track of and what each of us did, rather than just communicating with each other to check where each 
concept was at on our Kanban board and how much of it was done. Overall, the main benefit of the Kanban process was that it allowed for far more freedom than the Scrum methodology, but this was also a drawback as well as Scrum's
more strict organization ensured we were finishing tasks on time and distributing work more evenly.
