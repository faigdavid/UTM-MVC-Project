For this phase, we're planning to further add features so that our messaging app supports multiple users and a GUI; in contrast to demo where we had a console, single user, and a dummy server.  We will also add additional functionalities based on all of our user stories and its level importance such as: 

Leox: I want to be able to change the board I am viewing.

Leox: I want to be able to send other users private messages so I can communicate more directly.

Bin: I want to be able to subscribe to boards so I can keep track of specific boards.

Chuan: I want to be able to create my own board so that I can add new board topics.
