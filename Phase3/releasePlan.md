For this phase, we're planning to implement a working web server for our java application and multiple users; in contrast to our dummy server and a single user for our demo 
in phase 2.  We will also add additional functionalities based on all of our user stories and its level importance such as: 

Leox: I want to be able to move around layouts (boards/topics).

Bin: I want to be able to subscribe to topics and read messages without having to message other people.

Chuan: I should be able to create my own custom topics.
