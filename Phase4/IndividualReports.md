# Individual Reports

## David Faig (FaigDavid)

 * My most significant contrubution was making most of the skeleton code with Henry, and patching together everyone's code after they implemented their parts.
 * I learned a lot about DAO design patterns, Java GUIs, observer design patterns, and MVC design patterns. Overall, I feel as though I have a much stronger understanding of how Java applications work.
 * I understood the MVC design well since I helped make the skeleton code, so I was very helpfull in explaining the design to other team members.
 * I could have included more documentation strings in my skeleton code, and taking the time to organize code ahead of time.

## Henry Ekelund (ekelundh)

My most significant contrubtion to this project was my work on the DAOs, as well as my work in convering our older design into an MVC implementing program. 

I learned how to implement database servers into our programs as well as how to make seperate threads. 

I helped organize the team - no one was really willing to self organize at first (we got much better at this as time progressed)

I could have declared what I was working on specifically - because i didn't always declare what i was currently doing we run into quite a few git conflicts that were a huge pain to fix.

## Seung Hyun Kim (shk0307)

What is your most significant individual contribution?
* My most significant individual contribution is setting up postgreSQL server for the application.
* I wrote SQL query and functions to impose restrictions on SQL relations, and set correct timestamps for each messages.
* I also wrote most DAO's to write/build models to/from SQL server.

Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
* I've learned about DAO and MVC model concept which I found it very helpful when implementing postgreSQL server.

What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
* My main strength lies in finding problems/bugs in the code and provide possible solutions.

What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
* I could have worked better on proper error handlings such as raising proper exceptions
