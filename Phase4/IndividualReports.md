# Individual Reports

## David Faig (FaigDavid)

 * My most significant contrubution was making most of the skeleton code with Henry, and patching together everyone's code after they implemented their parts.
 * I learned a lot about DAO design patterns, Java GUIs, observer design patterns, and MVC design patterns. Overall, I feel as though I have a much stronger understanding of how Java applications work.
 * I understood the MVC design well since I helped make the skeleton code, so I was very helpfull in explaining the design to other team members.
 * I could have included more documentation strings in my skeleton code, and taking the time to organize code ahead of time.

## Henry Ekelund (ekelundh)

My most significant contrubtion to this project was my work on the DAOs, as well as my work in convering our older design into an MVC implementing program. 

I learned how to implement database servers into our programs as well as how to make seperate threads. 

I helped organize the team - no one was really willing to self organize at first (we got much better at this as time progressed)

I could have declared what I was working on specifically - because i didn't always declare what i was currently doing we run into quite a few git conflicts that were a huge pain to fix.

## Seung Hyun Kim (shk0307)

What is your most significant individual contribution?
* My most significant individual contribution is setting up postgreSQL server for the application.
* I wrote SQL query and functions to impose restrictions on SQL relations, and set correct timestamps for each messages.
* I also wrote most DAO's to write/build models to/from SQL server.

Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
* I've learned about DAO and MVC model concept which I found it very helpful when implementing postgreSQL server.

What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
* My main strength lies in finding problems/bugs in the code and provide possible solutions.

What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
* I could have worked better on proper error handlings such as raising proper exceptions

## Carlito Llena (R-ed)

What is your most significant individual contribution?
* My most significant contribution to this project was in Phase 2 and 4.  I implemented the User class and the first person designing the DashBoardGUI and BoardGUI classes.

Tell us about a new technical concept/issue that you learned while working on the project.
* I gained a better intuition on how the MVC, Observer, and DAO models work together.

What is your main strength(s) as a team member?
* My coding skills, everything was refactored that satisfied team standards.

What is your main weakness(es) as a team member? (i.e. Where do you think you can/should improve?)
* I didn't took the initiative early enough and so work was being finished by other people, this was a problem in Phase 3 when we were doing the Kanban process.  The freedom the process gave works
  well with people who take the initiative early.  Next time, I'll take the initiative earlier.

## Zhang An Ni (benbennza1)

* My most significant individual contribution was making the main class in the console stage (phase 1) and developing the GUI for the final presentation.

* While working on the project, I learned the kanban process, DAO and MVC, they seem really hard in the beginning, but once it is implemented it gets really easy.

* My main strength as a team member is cheering the team up, there is nothing bad about making the team happy and making this a memorable experience.

* My main weakness as a team member is I am lazy, if no one tells me to do something, I will probably not do it.

## Dmitry Vasin (trallgorm)

* My most significant contribution was the work on the GUI of the program, mostly the login, register, and dashboard GUIs. Another big part that sadly didn't make it to the presentation due to technical difficulties was the Android port.
* I certainly learned the importance of proper DAO's during the project. Since we switched DAO structures at least twice it was apparent that we would have spent a lot of time reworking our code if not for our great DAO design. Learning more about this topic and how it could be used to make programming more efficient was very interesting. 
* My main strength as a team member is my ability to write proper documentation and the ability to focus and work hard when in a pair or small group. While working in a group of 6 was distracting, pair programming the GUI with Ben showed that it was clearly efficient and a powerful combination.
* My main weakness as a team member was not being able to discuss designs properly. I usually just accepted what others decided our design should be and we ended up with code that was needlessly complex. If I were to look into it deeper and discuss why we were implementing it that way, we may have saved some precious time.
