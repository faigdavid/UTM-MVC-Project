## FaigDavid

 * My most significant contrubution was making most of the skeleton code with Henry, and patching together everyone's code after they implemented their parts.
 * I understood the MVC design well since I helped make the skeleton code, so I was very helpfull in explaining the design to other team members.
 * I could have included more documentation strings in my skeleton code, and taking the time to organize code ahead of time.
