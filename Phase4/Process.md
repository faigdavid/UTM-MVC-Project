 
Throughout the development of this product we have utilized many techniques. At first we used the Scrum methodology but during the next phase we switched over to Kanban. We thought it would be superior, but were surprised in that sense. While it is true that Kanban has plenty of benefits, with the main one being the freedom from bureacracy and thus more time allowed to be spent on actual coding. Unlike Scrum we didn't have to write reports or have daily meetings, which was a breath of fresh air. However we soon figured out this was a double edged sword. We had trouble organizing ourselves properly without the rigidity  of the Scrum process. Since there were no daily meetings there was more reason to procrastinate and put off the work until later on, which hurt us slightly in the end.
