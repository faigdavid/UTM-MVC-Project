Throughout the development of this product we have utilized many techniques.
We as a group thought that the Scrum process and Skype were the best tools and techniques
that worked for out team.  The Scrum process forced all of the team to put work into the project
because each member didn't want to show that we didn't do work during the end of a sprint cycle.
Skype worked well for us because we all have it and keep most of the time on the computer (sadly),
and so we were able to communicate with each other with no difficulty.   

Despite using good techniques, we found techniques that didn't work well in our group, as a group,
we decided that the Kanban process was not an effective technique. 
We thought Kanban would be superior, but were surprised to find the opposite. 
While it is true that Kanban has plenty of benefits, with the main one being the freedom from 
bureaucracy and thus more time allowed to be spent on actual coding. Unlike Scrum we didn't have to
write reports or have daily meetings, which was a breath of fresh air. However we soon figured 
out this was a double edged sword. We had trouble organizing ourselves properly without the rigidity
of the Scrum process. Since there were no daily meetings there was more reason to procrastinate 
and put off the work until later on, which hurt us slightly in the end. 

If we were to design an ideal process in our group, we think that we would use the Scrum process
along with paired programming.  We think that this is most effective because as mentioned, 
the Scrum process was effective for us and the use of paired programming in phase four helped us
understand better what the other person is communicating and also produce better quality code.
