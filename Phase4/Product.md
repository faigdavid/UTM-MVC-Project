Although some chose to implement the messaging app as a web service similar to Blackboard, we instead interpreted it as a standalone chatting program. In our efforts to go
above the expectations, we made our app that supports a graphics user interface (GUI) despite the handout not telling to implement such a feature.
This is similar to many IRC apps where you can join certain chatrooms and chat about a topic. A typical usage scenario will likely be similar among many different users. 
When the app is first launched the user is greeted with a login screen which asks for a username and password as well as three buttons: Login, Register and Exit. 
If the user chooses to exit then they are presented with a prompt asking whether they are sure or not. 
Register is also intuitive as it consists of a form asking the user to fill in their username and password, and to also confirm their password. 
Once the user is registered correctly or has logged in through the login screen, he or she enters the Dashboard part of the app. 
In this dashboard a user can create boards (chatrooms) and specify their name as well as their topic. 
A topic is essentially a title of the chatroom, and appears at the top part of the chatroom. 
You can also join existing boards by selecting a board from a dropdown menu which contains all available boards.
One cool feature we implemented that wasn't part of the original handout was the ability to search through the existing boards through a tagging system. 
The users can tag a board with a descriptor and other users will be able to find boards based on this descriptor. 
One way to utilize this is to tag all boards relevant to the 301 course with the 'csc301' tag. 
Thus by searching it up users could immediately see all the boards related to CSC301. 
Similarly when someone is working on an assignment they could just search up the tags related to the assignment and narrow down their search with tags like "assistance", 
"help", "discussion" or a particular question they needed help with. 
This really makes the whole program more organized and easy to use as a student looking for particular topics as well as general ones. 
You can also subscribe to a board which means it is added to the users list of subscribed boards which they can access with the press of a button to keep track of what topics 
they are interested in. Once you join a board you can post messages just like in any messaging app with your username and time of posting being displayed similar to Skype. 
Messages can be sent very quickly, almost instantaneously, as we made our DAO's very efficient. Inside the chatroom you can also tag boards, and subscribe to them. 
At any point of the program you can log out or exit the program with a click of a button.
