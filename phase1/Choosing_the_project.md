After some consideration and discussions during our Skype chats we have decided to go with the Messenger App as our project of choice. There are a couple reasons as to why this was our decision. First off, we felt that this app could actually be useful and something that can be a real product rather than just a simple theoretical exercise. It also doesn't require a large amount of effort for it to be useful. For example, if we chose the Treasure Hunt app it would be completely useless unless it was endorsed by the university and used by hundreds of people. Even if only our group uses the messaging app for communication, it would still be a useful tool. On top of that this project has a lot of possibilites for features and we aren't limited by having to make a simple product. It can be anything ranging from a basic messaging app with the ability to send and receive messages, to a full fledged social networking application, if we ever chose to continue working on the project. If we did choose to keep working on the program after we have completed the assignment it could potentially become a real product that we could show both to our future customers and employers. It would also not be incredibly difficult as we use apps similar to this one on a daily basis and thus know what is required and what are the features we would expect. Since not all of us use a scheduling application or have even been to Frosh Week, it would be more difficult to design those apps.
