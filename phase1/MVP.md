  Our chat client (hereby to be refered to as "The product") is unique in many ways in that it facilitates comunications amoung students by allowing the students themselves to create much content, and to have as much power as possible, as we believe that the more powerful the product is, the more people will be drawn to use it. The general design of the chat client will be a basic GUI that will allow the consumer to easily filter through any of the chat channels that they have open. Joining and leaving chat channels will be as easy as a button click, with advanced commands availible for those willing to use them - all channels can have(but do not require) moderators, and new chat rooms can be created instantly for those who wish to use them. By categorizing chat rooms with tags, we allow for any user to find a multitude of chat rooms that will allow them to express themselves, find new friends, or even a new minor!
  
  
  In terms of what the product will be able to do, users can expect to be able to join, leave and create chat rooms, which will have a multiude of modifiers (no sign in required, swear filters, and more). It will be possible to invite specific users to join a room, and users will be able to private message anyone that is online (assuming they ahve that persons screen name). User will also have a @USERNAME channel, which only they can join, which will have the ability to recieve updates from certain chatrooms. 
  
  
  All in all, our product aims to be a replacement for the discussion board on blackboard and possibly for blackboard itself, and will only faclicate other campus activities like club meet ups and events.
