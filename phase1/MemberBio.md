Carlito Llena

Computer scientist who is a pianist and a famed duelist (don't challenge him if you're a scrub please).  If Carlito isn't duelling someone, he also does coding in his spare time, mainly in programming languages such as, C, Java, and Javascript. An unfortunate weakness of this man is that he has no experience in Android development. Carlito is a very creative student, who uses his computer science skills in any way he can, he demonstrated this ability during his internship last year at the RIC Centre, where he programmed a software that automated a method of parsing an entire database from Microsoft Excel.
