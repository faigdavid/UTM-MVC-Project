Zhang An Ni (Ben)

Mountain Dew and Pizza powered computer science student who enjoys playing games for most of his life,
who has some experience in Android development (entry level).
He is a very flexible person, willing to do test cases if no one in the team wants to do them.
This person is also the creater of the religion "Benism".

Dmitry Vasin

A programmer proficient in languages such as C, Java, and Python, with some expirience developing Android apps. 
This person is a capable coder but his strengths lie in writing technical reports and creating various documents required for efficient development.  His main weakness is not having expirience creating pretty designs and user interfaces. Instead he enjoys working on the underlying code, with a focus on network security. His hobbies include travelling to countries all over the globe and mountain hiking. On October 7th, 2014 Dmitry achieved the honor of becoming the High Priest of Benism.


Seung Hyun Kim (Shaun)

Computer scientist who has great coding skills in various languages such as C, java, python, and scheme. Seung Hyun is a landed immigrant from South Korea since 2006 and is currently studying at University of Toronto majoring computer science. His strength lies in solving challenging problems related to coding such as finding more efficient algorithms to solve given problems. However, his weakness lies in writing documents and time managements. Moreover, he gets bored easily when he has to code that is more of macro-like-work, i.e. test cases, rather than that requires critical thinking. His overall goal in life is to take a part in coding a program that is used widely worldwide and get paid well.

Carlito Llena

Computer scientist who is a pianist and a famed duelist (don't challenge him if you're a scrub please).  If Carlito isn't duelling someone, he also does coding in his spare time, mainly in programming languages such as, C, Java, and Javascript. An unfortunate weakness of this man is that he has no experience in Android development. Carlito is a very creative student, who uses his computer science skills in any way he can, he demonstrated this ability during his internship last year at the RIC Centre, where he programmed a software that automated a method of parsing an entire database from Microsoft Excel.  On October 11, 2014 Carlito launched a successful crusade against the Benism faith.

Henry Ekelund

A full time student with a chip on his shoulder, Henry spends pretty much all of his time not at school playing games, both traditional and electronic. He enjoys progressive music of all forms, and is currently really digging math rock. His overall goal in life is either to find employment at Valve, or start his own business and retire young. His strengths are in algothrim development and deployment, as well as working well under extreme pressure. Is not very good at paying attention to things he has no interest in.


David Faig

A student at University of Toronto with a dream of becoming a great video game developer. He has mediocre school skills, and manages to get by with average grades. His goals are fueled by his childhood filled with video games and fantasy books. He enjoys pitching new movie and game concepts to his peers and seeing their skeptical reactions.  So far David has made one game, and written several short stories that are hidden somewhere in his room. Hopefully David's imagination and game-fueled drive can become an asset for this rag-tag team of interweb magicians.
