Zhang An Ni (Ben)

Mountain Dew and Pizza powered computer science student who enjoys playing games for most of his life,
who has some experience in Android development (entry level).
He is a very flexible person, willing to do test cases if no one in the team wants to do them.
This person is also the creater of the religion "benism".

Carlito Llena

Computer scientist who is a pianist and a famed duelist (don't challenge me if you're a scrub pls).  If Carlito isn't duelling someone, he also does coding in his spare time, mainly in programming languages such as, C, Java, and Javascript. An unfortunate weakness of this man is that he has no experience in Android development. Carlito is a hard working determined person who would be willing to do a fair share of work for the team.
