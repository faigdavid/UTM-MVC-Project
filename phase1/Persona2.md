#Bin Von Garbaccio IIX#

age: 18 and three quarters

Bin is a first year student in Commerce. In high school, he was at the top of his class, and his tuition is fully covered by his prestigious scholarship. His mother always tells him he is good looking , so he has that going for him. He is still trying to develop his relationship skills, which appear to be lacking despite his mother's opinion on how amazing he looks. His typical session on the computer involves using Facebook and other social media websites. Bin lives in residence with three roommates who he never talks to. He goes to every lecture, but he is too shy to participate or ask questions. He uses his phone frequently to Snapchat his mother and play SwingCopters. You might also find him using his phone to browse 9GAG.
