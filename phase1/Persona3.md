#AGE: 21#

Female


Chuan is a fourth year computer science student. She is hoping to graduate after her fifth year,
since she's had to take a year off to work and have a break from school. She is very disorganized and slightly lazy,
so she relies heavily on her peers and online resources to keep up with her classes.
She spends much of her time in the computer labs completing assignments and playing computer games like League of Legends. 
As a teacher's  assistant she dedicates a portion of her time to mark submissions and communicate important information to
her students. Being a female in computer science, she is used to boys looking at her as if she were a unicorn.
Because of this, she prefers to avoid direct communication with her peers.
