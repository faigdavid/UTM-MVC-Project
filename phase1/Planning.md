For our first release, we decided to exclude Leox's user story, P2P sharing feature, and a history tracker component.  A lot of ideas presented in Leox's user story was rated a '3', being the least significant for a viable product, therefore we decided to exclude Leox's user story for the first release.  The P2P sharing feature, while a good idea when it was pitched at the time, was eventually decided to be excluded because a server-client model can be used to manage the messaging app and a server-client model in our group's opinion, is easier to implement than P2P sharing.  Lastly, we decided to scrap the history tracker component simply because it is not mentioned anywhere in the project description, and so as a group, we made a unanimous decision to exclude this component. For our first week we will attempt to achieve basic functionality and some simple features like seeing related topics and anonymous messaging.
