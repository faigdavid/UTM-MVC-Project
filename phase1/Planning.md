For our first release, we decided to exclude Leox's user story, P2P sharing feature, and a history tracker component.  A lot of ideas presented in Leox's user story was rated a '1', being the most least significant for the most viable product, therefore we decided to exclude Leox's user story for the first release.  The P2P sharing feature, while a good idea when it was pitched at the time, was eventually decided to exclude because a server-client model can be used to manage the messaging app and a server-client model in our group's opinion, is easier to implement than a P2P sharing.  Lastly, we decided to scrap a history tracker component simply because it is not mentioned anywhere in the project description, and so as a group, we made a unanimous decision to exclude this component.
